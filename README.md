# CQE Results Analyzer

This is a set of SQL and shell scripts to load and analyze the DARPA Cyber
Grand Challenge Qualifying Event (CGC CQE) results using PostgreSQL. It loads
the "detailed scores" data (from [the CGC repository website][cqe_results])
into Postgres tables that are easy to query.

[cqe_results]: http://repo.cybergrandchallenge.com/cqe_results/

1. Clone this project locally.
2. Have PostgreSQL up and running in such a fashion that `psql` and `createdb`
   do the right thing. Tested with PostgreSQL 9.4.4 from Homebrew on Mac OS X El
   Capitan 10.11 Beta (15A215h).
3. Make sure no `cqe_results` database exists.
4. Run `bin/load`. This script creates a `cqe_resutls` database, creates a
   `cqe_scores` table, copies the `CQE_SCORES.csv` file into said table, adds a
   primary key, and finally, runs the scripts in `src/views` to create SQL
   views for some "interesting" reports.
5. `psql -c "select * from unsolved_csets" cqe_results` or something like that.

## Developing

### Easy mode

File an issue on this repo describing what you'd like to see. If I have the
time and inclination, I'll give it a shot.

### Hard mode

0. Fork and clone this repo.
1. Design a query.
2. Make a new `.sql` file in `src/views`. Ideally, the name of the file will be
   the same as the view it defines.
3. Define your query as a view in said file. Copy `src/views/scores.sql` if
   you wish.
4. Commit it.
5. Push it to your fork.
6. Make a pull request.
